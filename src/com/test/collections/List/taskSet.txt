1. Create a Set of Integer values. store 10 values inside.
   create a Map<Integer, String> have 10 entries inside map.
   now, the set against map
   for example :  uh have Set <1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10>
   and uh have one of the map entry like key : 5 and value : "shekar"
   so you got map entry for one of the set value.

   1.1 so check for all the set values whether this map is having a matching value or not.
   1.2 for non matching keys, put them in a seperate list. in the last print all those list values

2. Create a list of integers.
   Find out how many duplicates values it is having and print them all.
   from non duplicate values, find out how many of them are even and how many of them are odd. print them all and count as well.
